 #Main: Guess a number
=begin
6.Bonus problem: If youâ€˜re feeling the need for a little more, write a program that picks a random number. 
   Let a player guess the number, telling the player whether the guess is too low or too high.
   (Hint: rand(10)  will generate a random number from 0 to 9, and gets  will read a string from the keyboard
   that you can translate to an integer.)

=end
puts "Guess a number between 0 and 9"
randomNumer = rand(10)
puts randomNumer
playerNumber = gets()
while true
    while true
        if playerNumber.to_i >randomNumer
            puts "Too Large"
        elsif playerNumber.to_i < randomNumer
            puts "Too Small"
        else
            puts "That's cool! You guess number successfully"
            puts "Do you want play again?(Y/N)" 
            playInput = gets()
            if playInput.to_s == "Y"
                puts "the game begin again!"
            elsif playInput.to_s == "N"
                exit
            end
        end
        puts "Please guess again!"
        playerNumber = gets()
    end
end
